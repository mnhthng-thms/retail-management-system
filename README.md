# Retail Management System

Web Application Prototype for Cloud-based Retail Management System.
This project is my code submission for Unit 16-'Cloud Computing' of [Pearson BTEC Higher National Diploma in Computing Level 5](https://qualifications.pearson.com/en/qualifications/btec-higher-nationals.html).
